 * Usually symbolic links in the destination path are resolved. This
 * means that (1) the lockfile is created by adding &quot;.lock&quot; to the
 * resolved path, and (2) upon commit, the resolved path is
 * overwritten. However, if `LOCK_NO_DEREF` is set, then the lockfile
 * is created by adding &quot;.lock&quot; to the path argument itself. This
 * option is used, for example, when detaching a symbolic reference,
 * which for backwards-compatibility reasons, can be a symbolic link
 * containing the name of the referred-to-reference.
