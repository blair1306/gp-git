<dec f='include/expat.h' l='711' type='enum XML_Error XML_UseForeignDTD(XML_Parser parser, XML_Bool useDTD)'/>
<doc f='include/expat.h' l='692'>/* If useDTD == XML_TRUE is passed to this function, then the parser
   will assume that there is an external subset, even if none is
   specified in the document. In such a case the parser will call the
   externalEntityRefHandler with a value of NULL for the systemId
   argument (the publicId and context arguments will be NULL as well).
   Note: For the purpose of checking WFC: Entity Declared, passing
     useDTD == XML_TRUE will make the parser behave as if the document
     had a DTD with an external subset.
   Note: If this function is called, then this must be done before
     the first call to XML_Parse or XML_ParseBuffer, since it will
     have no effect after that.  Returns
     XML_ERROR_CANT_CHANGE_FEATURE_ONCE_PARSING.
   Note: If the document does not have a DOCTYPE declaration at all,
     then startDoctypeDeclHandler and endDoctypeDeclHandler will not
     be called, despite an external subset being parsed.
   Note: If XML_DTD is not defined when Expat is compiled, returns
     XML_ERROR_FEATURE_REQUIRES_XML_DTD.
