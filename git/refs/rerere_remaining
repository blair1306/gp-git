 * that rerere could handle.  Abuse the list by adding other types of
 * entries to allow the caller to show &quot;rerere remaining&quot;.
 *
 * - Conflicted paths that rerere does not handle are added
 * - Conflicted paths that have been resolved are marked as such
 *   by storing RERERE_RESOLVED to .util field (where conflict ID
 *   is expected to be stored).
 *
 * Do *not* write MERGE_RR file out after calling this function.
 *
 * NEEDSWORK: we may want to fix the caller that implements &quot;rerere
 * remaining&quot; to do this without abusing merge_rr.
