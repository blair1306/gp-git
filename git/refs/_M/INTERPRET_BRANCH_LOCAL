 * This reads short-hand syntax that not only evaluates to a commit
 * object name, but also can act as if the end user spelled the name
 * of the branch from the command line.
 *
 * - &quot;@{-N}&quot; finds the name of the Nth previous branch we were on, and
 *   places the name of the branch in the given buf and returns the
 *   number of characters parsed if successful.
 *
 * - &quot;&lt;branch&gt;@{upstream}&quot; finds the name of the other ref that
 *   &lt;branch&gt; is configured to merge with (missing &lt;branch&gt; defaults
 *   to the current branch), and places the name of the branch in the
 *   given buf and returns the number of characters parsed if
 *   successful.
 *
 * If the input is not of the accepted format, it returns a negative
 * number to signal an error.
 *
 * If the input was ok but there are not N branch switches in the
 * reflog, it returns 0.
 *
 * If &quot;allowed&quot; is non-zero, it is a treated as a bitfield of allowable
 * expansions: local branches (&quot;refs/heads/&quot;), remote branches
 * (&quot;refs/remotes/&quot;), or &quot;HEAD&quot;. If no &quot;allowed&quot; bits are set, any expansion is
 * allowed, even ones to refs outside of those namespaces.
