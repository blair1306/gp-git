<doc f='include/expat.h' l='237'>/* Prepare a parser object to be re-used.  This is particularly
   valuable when memory allocation overhead is disproportionatly high,
   such as when a large number of small documnents need to be parsed.
   All handlers are cleared from the parser, except for the
   unknownEncodingHandler. The parser&apos;s external state is re-initialized
   except for the values of ns and ns_triplets.

   Added in Expat 1.95.3.
