 * Represent a group of changed lines in an xdfile_t (i.e., a contiguous group
 * of lines that was inserted or deleted from the corresponding version of the
 * file). We consider there to be such a group at the beginning of the file, at
 * the end of the file, and between any two unchanged lines, though most such
 * groups will usually be empty.
 *
 * If the first line in a group is equal to the line following the group, then
 * the group can be slid down. Similarly, if the last line in a group is equal
 * to the line preceding the group, then the group can be slid up. See
 * group_slide_down() and group_slide_up().
 *
 * Note that loops that are testing for changed lines in xdf-&gt;rchg do not need
 * index bounding since the array is prepared with a zero at position -1 and N.
