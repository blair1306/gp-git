 * Leaf nodes come in two variants, note entries and subtree entries,
 * distinguished by the LSb of the leaf node pointer (see above).
 * As a note entry, the key is the SHA1 of the referenced object, and the
 * value is the SHA1 of the note object.
 * As a subtree entry, the key is the prefix SHA1 (w/trailing NULs) of the
 * referenced object, using the last byte of the key to store the length of
 * the prefix. The value is the SHA1 of the tree object containing the notes
 * subtree.
