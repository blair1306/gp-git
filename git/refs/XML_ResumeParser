<doc f='include/expat.h' l='820'>/* Resumes parsing after it has been suspended with XML_StopParser().
   Must not be called from within a handler call-back. Returns same
   status codes as XML_Parse() or XML_ParseBuffer().
   Additional error code XML_ERROR_NOT_SUSPENDED possible.   

   *Note*:
   This must be called on the most deeply nested child parser instance
   first, and on its parent parser only after the child parser has finished,
   to be applied recursively until the document entity&apos;s parser is restarted.
   That is, the parent parser will not resume by itself and it is up to the
   application to call XML_ResumeParser() on it at the appropriate moment.
