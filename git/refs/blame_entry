 * Each group of lines is described by a blame_entry; it can be split
 * as we pass blame to the parents.  They are arranged in linked lists
 * kept as `suspects&apos; of some unprocessed origin, or entered (when the
 * blame origin has been finalized) into the scoreboard structure.
 * While the scoreboard structure is only sorted at the end of
 * processing (according to final image line number), the lists
 * attached to an origin are sorted by the target line number.
