 * Validates that the requested branch may be created, returning the
 * interpreted ref in ref, force indicates whether (non-head) branches
 * may be overwritten. A non-zero return value indicates that the force
 * parameter was non-zero and the branch already exists.
 *
 * Contrary to all of the above, when attr_only is 1, the caller is
 * not interested in verifying if it is Ok to update the named
 * branch to point at a potentially different commit. It is merely
 * asking if it is OK to change some attribute for the named branch
 * (e.g. tracking upstream).
 *
 * NEEDSWORK: This needs to be split into two separate functions in the
 * longer run for sanity.
