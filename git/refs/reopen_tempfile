 * Re-open a temporary file that has been closed using
 * `close_tempfile()` but not yet deleted or renamed. This can be used
 * to implement a sequence of operations like the following:
 *
 * * Create temporary file.
 *
 * * Write new contents to file, then `close_tempfile()` to cause the
 *   contents to be written to disk.
 *
 * * Pass the name of the temporary file to another program to allow
 *   it (and nobody else) to inspect or even modify the file&apos;s
 *   contents.
 *
 * * `reopen_tempfile()` to reopen the temporary file. Make further
 *   updates to the contents.
 *
 * * `rename_tempfile()` to move the file to its permanent location.
