 * Returns first character length in bytes for multi-byte `text` according to
 * `encoding`.
 *
 * - The `text` pointer is updated to point at the next character.
 * - When `remainder_p` is not NULL, on entry `*remainder_p` is how much bytes
 *   we can consume from text, and on exit `*remainder_p` is reduced by returned
 *   character length. Otherwise `text` is treated as limited by NUL.
