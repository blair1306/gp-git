 * Flags controlling behaviour of for_each_note()
 *
 * Default behaviour of for_each_note() is to traverse every single note object
 * in the given notes tree, unpacking subtree entries along the way.
 * The following flags can be used to alter the default behaviour:
 *
 * - DONT_UNPACK_SUBTREES causes for_each_note() NOT to unpack and recurse into
 *   subtree entries while traversing the notes tree. This causes notes within
 *   those subtrees NOT to be passed to the callback. Use this flag if you
 *   don&apos;t want to traverse _all_ notes, but only want to traverse the parts
 *   of the notes tree that have already been unpacked (this includes at least
 *   all notes that have been added/changed).
 *
 * - YIELD_SUBTREES causes any subtree entries that are encountered to be
 *   passed to the callback, before recursing into them. Subtree entries are
 *   not note objects, but represent intermediate directories in the notes
 *   tree. When passed to the callback, subtree entries will have a trailing
 *   slash in their path, which the callback may use to differentiate between
 *   note entries and subtree entries. Note that already-unpacked subtree
 *   entries are not part of the notes tree, and will therefore not be yielded.
 *   If this flag is used together with DONT_UNPACK_SUBTREES, for_each_note()
 *   will yield the subtree entry, but not recurse into it.
