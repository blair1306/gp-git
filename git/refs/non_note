 * A notes tree may contain entries that are not notes, and that do not follow
 * the naming conventions of notes. There are typically none/few of these, but
 * we still need to keep track of them. Keep a simple linked list sorted alpha-
 * betically on the non-note path. The list is populated when parsing tree
 * objects in load_subtree(), and the non-notes are correctly written back into
 * the tree objects produced by write_notes_tree().
