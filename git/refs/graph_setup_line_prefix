 * Called to setup global display of line_prefix diff option.
 *
 * Passed a diff_options structure which indicates the line_prefix and the
 * file to output the prefix to. This is sort of a hack used so that the
 * line_prefix will be honored by all flows which also honor &quot;--graph&quot;
 * regardless of whether a graph has actually been setup. The normal graph
 * flow will honor the exact diff_options passed, but a NULL graph will cause
 * display of a line_prefix to stdout.
