 * Disallow/allow rehashing of the hashmap.
 * This is useful if the caller knows that the hashmap needs multi-threaded
 * access.  The caller is still required to guard/lock searches and inserts
 * in a manner appropriate to their usage.  This simply prevents the table
 * from being unexpectedly re-mapped.
 *
 * It is up to the caller to ensure that the hashmap is initialized to a
 * reasonable size to prevent poor performance.
 *
 * A call to allow rehashing does not force a rehash; that might happen
 * with the next insert or delete.
