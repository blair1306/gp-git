<doc f='include/expat.h' l='32'>/* The XML_Status enum gives the possible return values for several
   API functions.  The preprocessor #defines are included so this
   stanza can be added to code that still needs to support older
   versions of Expat 1.95.x:

   #ifndef XML_STATUS_OK
   #define XML_STATUS_OK    1
   #define XML_STATUS_ERROR 0
   #endif

   Otherwise, the #define hackery is quite ugly and would have been
   dropped.
