<doc f='include/expat.h' l='924'>/* These functions return information about the current parse
   location.  They may be called from any callback called to report
   some parse event; in this case the location is the location of the
   first of the sequence of characters that generated the event.  When
   called from callbacks generated by declarations in the document
   prologue, the location identified isn&apos;t as neatly defined, but will
   be within the relevant markup.  When called outside of the callback
   functions, the position indicated will be just past the last parse
   event (regardless of whether there was an associated callback).
   
   They may also be called after returning from a call to XML_Parse
   or XML_ParseBuffer.  If the return value is XML_STATUS_ERROR then
   the location is the location of the character at which the error
   was detected; otherwise the location is the location of the last
   parse event, as described above.
