 * Remove the entry with the given name from dir, recursing into
 * subdirectories as necessary.  If refname is the name of a directory
 * (i.e., ends with &apos;/&apos;), then remove the directory and its contents.
 * If the removal was successful, return the number of entries
 * remaining in the directory entry that contained the deleted entry.
 * If the name was not found, return -1.  Please note that this
 * function only deletes the entry from the cache; it does not delete
 * it from the filesystem or ensure that other cache entries (which
 * might be symbolic references to the removed entry) are updated.
 * Nor does it remove any containing dir entries that might be made
 * empty by the removal.  dir must represent the top-level directory
 * and must already be complete.
