 * Transaction states.
 *
 * OPEN:   The transaction is initialized and new updates can still be
 *         added to it. An OPEN transaction can be prepared,
 *         committed, freed, or aborted (freeing and aborting an open
 *         transaction are equivalent).
 *
 * PREPARED: ref_transaction_prepare(), which locks all of the
 *         references involved in the update and checks that the
 *         update has no errors, has been called successfully for the
 *         transaction. A PREPARED transaction can be committed or
 *         aborted.
 *
 * CLOSED: The transaction is no longer active. A transaction becomes
 *         CLOSED if there is a failure while building the transaction
 *         or if a transaction is committed or aborted. A CLOSED
 *         transaction can only be freed.
