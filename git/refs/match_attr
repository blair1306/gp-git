 * One rule, as from a .gitattributes file.
 *
 * If is_macro is true, then u.attr is a pointer to the git_attr being
 * defined.
 *
 * If is_macro is false, then u.pat is the filename pattern to which the
 * rule applies.
 *
 * In either case, num_attr is the number of attributes affected by
 * this rule, and state is an array listing them.  The attributes are
 * listed as they appear in the file (macros unexpanded).
