<doc f='include/expat.h' l='786'>/* Stops parsing, causing XML_Parse() or XML_ParseBuffer() to return.
   Must be called from within a call-back handler, except when aborting
   (resumable = 0) an already suspended parser. Some call-backs may
   still follow because they would otherwise get lost. Examples:
   - endElementHandler() for empty elements when stopped in
     startElementHandler(), 
   - endNameSpaceDeclHandler() when stopped in endElementHandler(), 
   and possibly others.

   Can be called from most handlers, including DTD related call-backs,
   except when parsing an external parameter entity and resumable != 0.
   Returns XML_STATUS_OK when successful, XML_STATUS_ERROR otherwise.
   Possible error codes: 
   - XML_ERROR_SUSPENDED: when suspending an already suspended parser.
   - XML_ERROR_FINISHED: when the parser has already finished.
   - XML_ERROR_SUSPEND_PE: when suspending while parsing an external PE.

   When resumable != 0 (true) then parsing is suspended, that is, 
   XML_Parse() and XML_ParseBuffer() return XML_STATUS_SUSPENDED. 
   Otherwise, parsing is aborted, that is, XML_Parse() and XML_ParseBuffer()
   return XML_STATUS_ERROR with error code XML_ERROR_ABORTED.

   *Note*:
   This will be applied to the current parser instance only, that is, if
   there is a parent parser then it will continue parsing when the
   externalEntityRefHandler() returns. It is up to the implementation of
   the externalEntityRefHandler() to call XML_StopParser() on the parent
   parser (recursively), if one wants to stop parsing altogether.

   When suspended, parsing can be resumed by calling XML_ResumeParser().
