 * We need to keep track of how symlinks in the preimage are
 * manipulated by the patches.  A patch to add a/b/c where a/b
 * is a symlink should not be allowed to affect the directory
 * the symlink points at, but if the same patch removes a/b,
 * it is perfectly fine, as the patch removes a/b to make room
 * to create a directory a/b so that a/b/c can be created.

 * See also &quot;struct string_list symlink_changes&quot; in &quot;struct
 * apply_state&quot;.
