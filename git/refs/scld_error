 * Create the directory containing the named path, using care to be
 * somewhat safe against races. Return one of the scld_error values to
 * indicate success/failure. On error, set errno to describe the
 * problem.
 *
 * SCLD_VANISHED indicates that one of the ancestor directories of the
 * path existed at one point during the function call and then
 * suddenly vanished, probably because another process pruned the
 * directory while we were working.  To be robust against this kind of
 * race, callers might want to try invoking the function again when it
 * returns SCLD_VANISHED.
 *
 * safe_create_leading_directories() temporarily changes path while it
 * is working but restores it before returning.
 * safe_create_leading_directories_const() doesn&apos;t modify path, even
 * temporarily.
