<doc f='include/expat.h' l='652'>/* If do_nst is non-zero, and namespace processing is in effect, and
   a name has a prefix (i.e. an explicit namespace qualifier) then
   that name is returned as a triplet in a single string separated by
   the separator character specified when the parser was created: URI
   + sep + local_name + sep + prefix.

   If do_nst is zero, then namespace information is returned in the
   default manner (URI + sep + local_name) whether or not the name
   has a prefix.

   Note: Calling XML_SetReturnNSTriplet after XML_Parse or
     XML_ParseBuffer has no effect.
