<doc f='include/expat.h' l='855'>/* Creates an XML_Parser object that can parse an external general
   entity; context is a &apos;\0&apos;-terminated string specifying the parse
   context; encoding is a &apos;\0&apos;-terminated string giving the name of
   the externally specified encoding, or NULL if there is no
   externally specified encoding.  The context string consists of a
   sequence of tokens separated by formfeeds (\f); a token consisting
   of a name specifies that the general entity of the name is open; a
   token of the form prefix=uri specifies the namespace for a
   particular prefix; a token of the form =uri specifies the default
   namespace.  This can be called at any point after the first call to
   an ExternalEntityRefHandler so longer as the parser has not yet
   been freed.  The new parser is completely independent and may
   safely be used in a separate thread.  The handlers and userData are
   initialized from the parser argument.  Returns NULL if out of memory.
   Otherwise returns a new XML_Parser object.
